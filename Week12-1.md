In summary, the more keywords I use in a search, the more precise the search results will be. Google Scholar has a comprehensive collection of academic literature, and I can select a specific year to view the most recently published papers. Additionally, by looking at the references cited in other people's papers, I can quickly gain insight into the most classic papers in a particular field of study. This is a shortcut to gain an understanding of research in a specific area.
