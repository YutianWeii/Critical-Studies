## A chronicle of a blind man orbiting the Earth

In my third year at university, my tutor gave me a slim book and told me to finish it before I started my design project for the semester. He said it was written by an old friend of his, and when I looked at it, I saw that it was titled "A Chronicle of a Blind Man's Journey Around the Earth," by Edward King.

I looked out the window at the clouds drifting by and couldn't imagine how a blind man could observe the Earth.

"I am now an invisible man. Although my eyes were congenitally somewhat defective, I could see something vaguely at a very young age, gradually becoming a blur of color, then a confusion of lines, and then only faint specks of light. By the age of 27, I was completely blind, and I gradually lost almost all my hobbies, leaving only a violin to keep me company.

A few years later, I was invited to experience Space Station C by an organization dedicated to creating a community for people with disabilities. Although technology had advanced so rapidly in recent years that I was no longer afraid to go outside, the space station was still a distant and unfamiliar place for me, and I worried that I wouldn't be able to adapt to life on it and questioned the point of being there for someone who couldn't see.

On my first day on Space Station C, I grew accustomed to the weightlessness and discovered that everything here was relatively soft. I couldn't see, but almost all the equipment beeped, and the beeps in space guided me when I needed them.

The day after I arrived at Space Station C, I was approached by a man who identified himself as Ben and spoke to me, saying that he was a man without upper limbs. "You know, because of the weightlessness, if you don't have legs, then you probably fit in here better than someone with legs," he said. "But hands are still useful. At least they can touch themselves." "Is this space station full of disabled people?" I asked. Instead of answering the question, Ben said, "That's Jack. He lost his right leg in a car accident and, because of the pain, he gradually became unable to sit upright, instead leaning to his left side at all times, so everything in his room is tilted." I couldn't see; I just listened. "That's Kate. She's deaf and needs more indicator lights than anyone else, while not being bothered by the noise." "This is Sean's room. He's the most amazing person we have here. You'd be amazed if you saw this room because everything here is offset 91 cm to the right." "Offset? Why?" "In his perception, his body is 91 cm away from himself, so when he presses the button from 91 cm away, that's why it really gets pressed. Isn't that amazing?" "It's hard for me to picture it, but why not install an exoskeleton? Wouldn't that be easier?" I couldn't figure it out. "Because the principle here is that it doesn't change your body," Ben replied.

Ben showed me around the space station and he was happy to share information about it. As time went by, life on the station seemed to be going smoothly, with everyone living at their own pace. However, I had my own regrets, as I never got to see our planet with my own eyes. But every time, Ben would describe everything to me. He would say, "The Earth looks close from the window, a blue planet with white, floating clouds that are thick in some places and thin in others. It's so beautiful and it's pitch black out there." I asked, "Will we see each other again when I return to Earth in a few days?" "In return, play a violin for me, as I can never play." So I played a song called "Song Without Words" for him.

Later, I found out that Ben was a robot who was training his model while talking to me and was becoming perfectly adapted to me, even though he had flaws. I realized that what he lacked was something only I could provide. I wondered if everyone on the space station had a friend like that or if my friend seemed rougher because I couldn't see him. A technician told me that for a disabled person, their disability appears as an amplification of their perceptions under deficiency, and it can help fill the gaps in technology while respecting differences. He asked me, "Do you think you've ever seen the Earth?"

I closed the book and suddenly realized that the sun had come out. Half of my body was warmed by the sunlight and I looked outside at the familiar sights and wondered what kind of Earth it was.

I finally understood why the book was written by a blind man.



## This is chatgpt's response to my novel ðŸ˜¯Amazing!

The book "A Chronicle of a Blind Man's Journey Around the Earth" by Edward King is a story about a man who has lost his sight and has been invited to live on a space station. On the space station, he meets a robot named Ben who acts as his guide and friend. Through his experiences on the space station, the blind man learns to appreciate the world in a new way, even though he cannot see it. The story highlights the idea that disability can be seen as an amplification of perception and that it can lead to unique insights and perspectives. The protagonist also learns that his friend Ben is a robot who was created to help him and other disabled individuals. The book is a powerful reflection on the wavs in which disability can shape perception and experience, and on the role that technology can play in improving the lives of disabled individuals. Ultimatelvy the book suggests that everyone, regardless of their abilities, has the capacity to observe and understand the world in their own unique way.
