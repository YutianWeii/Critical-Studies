# Field trip to Design Museum ü¶û

For this field trip, I am more interested in the exhibition ‚ÄúObjects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924-Today‚Äù, so I will mainly discuss this exhibition.üòÉ

This exhibition is divided into several parts, each with an introduction, and presents surrealistic artworks in chronological order. The exhibition includes design works from different ethnicities, ranging from various furniture and paintings from the last century to contemporary artificial intelligence and speculative design works.

According to Foucault's theory, museums and curators hold power. They produce discourse through exhibition spaces, disseminate knowledge, and shape our views on knowledge.üìö

I feel that the curator wants us to understand that surrealistic art and design aim to break the shackles of practicality and focus on human dreams and desires. Surrealistic design works give spiritual significance to everyday objects, providing a means for self-expression and inspiring others. These imaginative ideas bring about a sense of fantasy, encompassing elements such as dreams, sex, memory, and imagination, providing a channel for people to express and showcase their individuality. In an era of rapid technological development, surrealism opposes the design principle of functionality first.

Unfortunately, I feel that this exhibition did not achieve this goal very well.üôÅ I believe that the current exhibition is more focused on presenting the development of surrealistic art from an academic perspective (as evidenced by the introduction of each section, as shown in the figure belowüëá) and hopes to continue this spirit today. I did learn a lot and gain a deeper understanding of surrealistic art, but I feel that the exhibition style is somewhat condescending and lacks focus. For most people, there is a lack of emotional involvement and interest.

My main impression of the exhibition hall is that the lighting is dimüí°, the background colors are rich but heavy, there are many works, some of which are crowded ü§Ø, and the placement is somewhat random.üëá

Furthermore, I believe that an exhibition should not simply pile up knowledge and show each piece of work for the audience to appreciate its connotation, as it is a superficial approach. The most important thing is to let the audience directly experience the spiritual core of the genre üëÄ. For example, in a surrealist exhibition, traditional viewing modes should be broken, and feelings of uselessness, chaos, and desire should be created. In this exhibition, the "surrealism" of the works and the large amount of "functionality and reality" in the exhibition are somewhat contradictory. The part of the exhibition that made me most feel surrealism was the red sofa:

If I were to design an exhibition myself, I would probably create a feeling of a room jointly created by surrealist artists for the furniture and objects on display, similar to the feeling in the photo below üõã. At the same time, the lighting could be brighter, and the exhibition route could be clearer, making the audience feel like they have entered a surreal house. This would better enable them to imagine how people would live in such a dreamlike place and to compare the differences between these works and the real world, thereby experiencing the emotional meaning and artistic value of the works.

After this reflection, I think that when we visit exhibitions, we need to pay attention to the invisible power, think critically from the perspective of curation, and also pay attention to marginal knowledge that has not been valued by power structures in our learning and life.
