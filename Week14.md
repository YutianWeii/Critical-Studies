# Coding Literacy

## 1. What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy? üìí

The basic meaning of "literacy" is reading and writing, which also represents a way of cognitive thinking. Before the invention of computers, literacy manifested as the written acquisition or dissemination of information. In the information age, literacy also manifests as thinking and communicating information through typing, among other methods. I believe that literacy is built on the foundation of language, and the combination of different written languages across races yields billions of meanings, allowing us to communicate and learn. Literacy is the foundation of civilization and also the foundation of personal progress and human development.

Literacy includes a wide variety of types. I think calling computer programming a literacy means that programming has become a method for processing and presenting information, just like reading and writing, and it also affects people's way of thinking. This perspective demonstrates that programming is not just for programmers, but rather should be considered a method of thinking, allowing us to view the world from a new perspective and to think while programming. I believe that this perspective helps people to think from a computer's perspective, which is the method for creating and developing AI.

From the perspective of critical thinking, if programming is considered a form of literacy, the knowledge divide will take on another form. Programming becomes a gateway to accessing certain information, and those who have not had exposure to programming to some extent become isolated from that information, losing access to certain platforms and the ability to innovate. This drives people to learn programming languages, and programming may eventually become as commonplace as reading and writing on some future day.



## 2. New thoughts ü§î
### üëÄ the notion of coding literacy

    "Programming is a literacy we can build other activities and knowledge on, as we have done with reading and writing in human languages. 
    Because of its affordances for information creation, organization, and dissemination, the practice of programming bears other significant similarities to reading and writing. 
    Programming and writing are both socially inflected by the contexts in which they are learned and circulated and are materially shaped by the technologies that support and distribute them."

    Vee, Annette.¬†Coding Literacy : How Computer Programming Is Changing Writing, MIT Press, 2017.¬†

Computer code has an impact on contemporary communication, and "coding literacy" understands programming as a type of literacy. Looking at it this way, programming may gradually become an essential skill. In a world where everyone can understand code and learn programming, the future of platform interface design and methods of knowledge dissemination may undergo significant changes. 

But will this increase our efficiency? Programming is not very readable, so should we set boundaries to protect literature? Programming literacy can enhance a person's logical abilities, but obviously, ChatGPT has a much higher ability to understand code than I do. Does excessive rationality mean alienation from humanity, making us more like machines and losing our subjectivity as humans?

I find these questions difficult to answer.



### üíª live coding

    It is also worth remembering that all writing is technology, and live writing, like live coding, is able to activate slippages of meaning and ultimately demonstrate how writing subjects and objects become thoroughly entangled.


    The generative relationship between a notation and what is notated is what drives generative creativity in the live coding field. 
    The perceptual gap between the notational map and the generated territory allows the live coder to reach beyond their imagination and work with notation not to efficiently realize a ready-made idea but to follow an idea to see where it takes them.
    
    
    This chapter unpacks these ideas further, exploring how the momentary nature of a live coder‚Äôs notation might be closer to speech than to text. 
    Or rather, live coding practice finds itself caught between two worlds, as it is too ephemeral to be scorebased culture and yet too centered on text to be oral culture.

Live coding has further changed my understanding of coding. As written in the book, live coding highlights the subjectivity of individuals, making code appear as an immediate element. It breaks the pattern of first having an idea and then programming, and instead integrates programming into thinking and expression, using programming as a medium for thinking, and then feeding back into programming results, creating a loop. Such creativity is often random.

In live coding, time becomes more important, and participants are more focused on the process and time rather than the results. I am reminded of Happening art, and perhaps live coding can become a new means of Happening art in contemporary times.


### üéº Programming as Performance

Sam Aaron's introduction of programming as a form of performance provided me with a new perspective. Programming was once a tool hidden behind the scenes of a work, but now it can be showcased as a part of the work itself, allowing the audience to understand how the performance changes.

I think that here programming plays a role similar to that of a musical instrument, but the creative process using programming is not linear. Modifications in the creation process become easier and more efficient, and results can be obtained more directly.

However, limitations in the syntax of programming languages may lead to homogeneity in the core of the work, and artists need to break through the fixed patterns of programming in order to create.

I hope to also bring code to the forefront in my own work, imagining that there are many possibilities for transformation.



### üåç My mother was a computer

    In Morowitz‚Äôs view the human observer plays an indispensable role in the jump from the third stage (emergence of mind) to the fourth stage (emergence of reÔ¨Çexivity), for our ability to simulate complex processes within computers makes possible the next stage of emergences. 
    The Regime of Computation, then, provides a narrative that accounts for the evolution of the universe, life, mind, and mind reÔ¨Çecting on mind by connecting these emergences with computational processes that operate both in human-created simulations and in the universe understood as software running on the ‚ÄúUniversal Computer‚Äù we call reality. 
    This is the larger context in which code acquires special, indeed universal, signiÔ¨Åcance. In the Regime of Computation, code is understood as the discourse system that mirrors what happens in nature and that generates nature itself.
    
    Hayles, N. Katherine.¬†My Mother Was a Computer : Digital Subjects and Literary Texts, University of Chicago Press, 2005.¬†


The first part of this book puts forward hypotheses on the appearance and evolution of civilization from a broad perspective.

By means of computation, humanity may be able to discover a hidden model that explains various phenomena. From the emergence of the universe, to the emergence of all things, to the emergence of intelligent life, there may be some connections between them, and the computational power of computers and programming gives us new possibilities for explaining the world.

This is a grand idea, and perhaps computers and programming can serve as a tool for a cross-era change in human mentality.


2023.3.1 Addition:

After studying with coding2 neural networks, I have gained a deeper understanding of this topic. Machine learning, which is derived from neural networks, continuously calculates and discovers many unknown functions in the program, explaining our cognition while also enabling machines to have such thinking abilities. As this book explains, perhaps all things have underlying operating principles that can be presented through mathematical formulas, but we have not yet discovered them.
