# Week15-Gallery Visit

I don't know if you wanted us to choose works in the South London Gallery exhibition, but I feel like those works don't have a lot of parts related to ‚Äúcomputation‚Äù üôÅ, so I chose works from an artist I previously researched.

## Art Work- Map from Space üó∫Ô∏è
### Simon Weckert

Installation, 2017

The project deals with the process of "map making with satellite imagery" and questions the producer of this two mediums and their ability for limitation/interpretation and influence/transmission/acceptance of data and power. It intended to show the paradox of ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù in which ‚Äúsatellite imagery are producers for maps‚Äù and ‚Äúmaps are producers for satellite imagery‚Äù in a circulation with different transformational processes, where machine learning is used to analyse a huge datastream of satellite imagery.

## My review and interpretation of this work üßê

The "Map from Space" project showcases a neural network based on a self-feedback circuit system, which uses pre-defined knowledge as "training data" in the map-making process. Each newly generated data is directly written into the network as "training data" from which it gains knowledge. The map and satellite images affect each other and are causally linked. This work uses a program to present the process of their data changes. Satellite images are generated based on the map, and changes in the satellite images will affect the data obtained by the machine, which will in turn affect reality, indicating that every decision of the network is based on previous decisions.[2]

The theme of this work is that data is a representation of power, as the artist explains, ‚ÄúAs maps can not be realized without interpretation,generalization and simplification like the symbol ‚Äútree‚Äù for a forest or a ‚Äúred circle‚Äù for a city. It is the same for data which is used for ‚Äúremote sensing‚Äù. Data is always translated to what they might be presented. The images, lists, graphs, and maps that represent those data are all interpretations, and there is no such thing as neutral data. Data is always collected for a specific purpose, by a combination of people, technology, money, commerce, and government. The phase "data visualization," in that sense, is a bit redundant because data is already a visualization.‚Äù[2]

Furthermore, the model is defined by the people who create the program, and the categories and standards of the data are also determined by a very small number of people. The perspective they observe will affect the views of others, and thus affect the lives of everyone. ‚ÄúMachine learning is used nowadays in the process of map making in geographic informational systems in short ‚ÄúGIS‚Äù to observe the earth surface and detect abnormalities in real time and identify changes in short timeframes for e.g. industrial trends, mine activities, gas & oil mining area, urban trends, agriculture crop yield and so on. These systems are based on a model, where a predefined knowledge is used to generate new knowledge which opens the topic of the ‚Äúparadox of pattern recognition‚Äù. To identify patterns means, the pattern itself must be predefined in some ways, to be identified, for example to identify cloud formations for weather forecast means to classify thousands of clouds.‚Äù[2]

Human behavior affects data, while data also shapes human perspectives. The development of digital technology has made this phenomenon increasingly apparent.

These themes are related to Michel Foucault's discourse, knowledge, and power theory, which Hunter introduced to us two weeks ago. Michel Foucault viewed discourses as sites of power where knowledge is produced, controlled, and distributed. Power is productive: Foucault argued that power is not simply repressive or negative, but is also productive, enabling the creation and dissemination of knowledge, norms, and values. Last semester we also learned about data, and how unprocessed data does not exist.

Simon Weckert's other work, "Google Map Hacks," also explores the relationship between knowledge and power through maps. "99 second-hand smartphones are transported in a handcart to generate virtual traffic jam in Google Maps. Through this activity, it is possible to turn a green street red which has an impact in the physical world by navigating cars on another route to avoid being stuck in traffic."[4] I think these works are based on contemporary digital technology and present the underlying logic of technology, power, and behavior.

Returning to "Map from space," I appreciate the way it uses maps and satellite images to explore the issue of data and power. I have never seriously thought about the interactive relationship between maps and satellite images in motion. Their relationship, as a clever metaphor, presents complex truths to the audience and promotes our thinking about data, knowledge, and power structures. This way of thinking is easy to understand and accept, and I think it reflects the value of artistic reflection. Additionally, I can sense the artist's care for nature and human activities through this work. The map includes forests, cities, industries, farmland, and other information, and the work presents these information in an open and equal way.

Moreover, data and reality influence each other, and the generation and interpretation of data affect every node. People will adjust their behavior based on the model's expectations, which reminds me of determinism. Something that seems objectively neutral can actually have a far-reaching impact.

In my opinion, the presentation of the works can be further developed. Currently, the artist directly displays the changing satellite map scenes and outlines, which may not be distinctive enough. (Perhaps the artist wants to focus on the concept?)

I think there are two ways to change the effect of the work: one is to transform it into a more impressive visual effect, and the other is to use special materials for presentation. For example, Refik Anadol's "Quantum Memories" has a more amazing artistic effect.

However, Simon's insight into the hidden information behind maps and his thoughts on the relationships between technology, power, and behavior set him apart from other artists. The logic behind his works is convincing, and he boldly experiments with technology. These attempts broaden the boundaries of our thinking.

After understanding his works, when creating artwork or conducting critical research, I will focus on the tools of daily life. I should start from the details and observe the phenomena that reflect the underlying logic and social structure, and present them cleverly.

Moreover, I realize the importance of organizing logical ideas. In my opinion, a good artwork needs to be well done in two aspects. One is a clever idea, such as discovering the internal connection between different things and presenting it in an "unexpected but reasonable" way; the other is sincerity. We can always see whether the artist creates sincerely from the artwork. If the artist sincerely thinks and creates, this heartfelt feeling can be conveyed to the audience through the work. After seeing Simon's works, I am willing to take the initiative to understand these background information and be inspired by the enthusiasm for creation. This is the success of an artist.

I will bring the research into my creation, making my work more meaningful and worthy of scrutiny. First, I need to observe the details of life carefully, and secondly, I need to diligently search for information and find opportunities to create works.
In summary, combining research and art is very helpful. In the information and technology era, technology is not the end goal. When we pursue technology, we also need to slow down and think about the meaning and impact of technology.
