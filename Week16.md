# Trans and Posthumanism
## About Victoria Modesta ðŸ’ƒ

I believe that in the music video, Victoria Modesta gradually transitions from being transhuman to posthuman. At the beginning, Victoria, who is disabled, is shown walking with a focus on her legsðŸ¦¿, which are simulated to resemble normal legs and she wears high heels. She extends her abilities through technology, and her dance and clothing are more oriented towards pleasing humans, demonstrating that she is transhuman. However, at the end of the video, Victoria is no longer concerned with whether her legs resemble legs, and they have become pointed. She wears a mask and dances in a non-human manner, pulled by ropes. This demonstrates that her thinking has transcended the view that "humans must be like humans," and she has become a combination of technology and biology, gradually transitioning towards posthuman.

I think another interesting issue explored in the video is the worship and deification of Victoria. At the beginning of the video, Victoria sits on a throne, enjoying the service of those around her. The animated symbol representing Victoria is tattooed on a man's body, engraved on a table, and a little girl breaks the leg of a toy in homage to her, metaphorically representing some people's desire to become like her. She is also noticed by traditional institutions represented by the police, but their abilities cannot subdue her. This shows that individualism fostered by technology may trigger new powers and religions, leading to blind, irrational phenomena. This is also critical thinking about transhumanism.

At the end of the music video, Victoria dances alone, with no one participating or watching, becoming more free from the previous worship. She doesn't dance to please others, but rather focuses on individual feelings. All of these align with the concept of posthumanism. Humans don't necessarily have to appear in human form, dance in human habits, be stared at, or worship others. The world becomes more inclusive, with non-human forms and habits being recognized, and humans and non-humans are not in opposition. The music video only shows a small part of posthumanism, but the ethics, language, knowledge, and social systems related to posthumanism are all left for us to imagine. Perhaps after this, humans will become more rational and self-focused, and blind worship and attacks on the worshiped may disappear.

In conclusion, I believe that the majority of the music video showcases the state of transhumanism and society's reflection, with Victoria only becoming posthuman at 4 minutes and 56 seconds in. The entire music video is a process of Victoria transitioning from transhuman to posthuman, leaving a lot of space for imagination for the audience.
