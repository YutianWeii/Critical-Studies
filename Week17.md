# Minor Technology and Community-based Practice

This week, I learned about a low-energy, low-tech, community-based network that opposes efficiency and centralization. The current networks we use are for everyone, but not everyone needs the same things, which has led to the rapid development of personalized recommendations. However, personalized recommendations can lead to privacy concerns. Additionally, a large amount of computing is very energy-intensive, and the current network application structure generates a lot of energy and time waste. In addition, the number of users, website activity, and profit margins are highly valued in the commercial market and almost become the only criterion for evaluating websites. People are pursuing eye-catching data, often leading to information exaggeration or even falsehood. In this context, small-scale, lightweight network concepts have developed.

### Minus üìÑ

The most impressive thing for me in class was Minus, an experimental website that limits each user to 100 posts. Minus limits people's abilities and views time and attention as limited and valuable resources. It advocates for promoting conversation within a subtraction framework, hoping to avoid noise and fanaticism, and create a quieter, slower environment that highlights human voice, text, and timeliness.

I think this is a good concept, and we can experience limited expression through Minus, but for me, it's more like an art piece than a social website. I think this website is difficult to succeed for several reasons. First, it relies on time to display other people's text, so I can't filter information or find interesting topics to interact with others. Second, the limited number of posts makes people less motivated to post, resulting in much less information content than other websites. Third, when a user runs out of 100 chances to post, they will leave the website, regardless of whether there are better-quality information to share or not.

To me, Minus is a linear single-layer website that is more like a utopia. It will be an excellent resting place when we have no purpose or pressure. However, one day soon, we will also leave here.

### Small technology

‚ÄúThe smallnet crowd is DIY-minded; they self-host community-run servers and community-built services, often using limited CPU, memory, disk space, and bandwidth by choice, and using simple protocols, formats, and tools.‚Äù

I support the vision of using small technologies to protect privacy and prevent large companies from exercising excessive control over information. However, community-based websites may bring about more serious problems of knowledge divide and information silos. I have previously looked into the issue of digital migration, where our generation, as digital natives, has adapted well to the digitized society, but many older people and those in economically disadvantaged areas require significant effort to bridge this divide. Similarly, as community-based websites develop, they may lead to community solidification. People may become immersed in their familiar communities, making it difficult to break out of information silos. This could also become another form of power control.

Moreover, I find it hard to imagine how small technology can break through the current state of being suppressed by massively-scaled websites. Will people give up larger websites with more diverse content to choose websites led by small technology? Can we achieve a low-energy and harmonious online community? To reach such an ideal state, is it better to rely on technological upgrades or self-control?
