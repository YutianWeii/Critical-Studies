## Design a ‘Stupid’ AI System

The Stupid AI I imagine is a foolish navigation AI that I named "Stupid Guide (SG) 🗺️." SG cannot take me to my destination. Its map is correct, but the route is wrong. Its instructions may be random, continuously giving directions such as "turn left at the intersection ahead," "turn right at the biggest tree," "go straight to the bank building," etc. It may even take me on a detour and lead me in the opposite direction.

SG is not suitable for people who need to travel normally to their destination, but it is useful for people who have plenty of time but don't know where to go.

When I have a day off and don't know what to do or where to go, Stupid Guide may help me discover new places, see the surroundings from different perspectives, and generate new inspirations and experiences. 🚗

When I travel in a strange city, I heavily rely on the famous tourist spots 🎡, food 🍛🥘🥗🍔🍟, and internet-famous shops on social media. I follow the trend and take pictures, but that's not what I want. I need a navigation system with randomness, encounter unknown scenery.

I think Stupid AI will break the concept of efficiency supremacy and rebel against systems that pursue quick and convenient solutions. It encourages people to live in a meaningless, irrational state, even if this state only occupies a small part of life.

It is worth noting that this type of Stupid AI needs to declare its characteristics to the user before use, and should be distinguished from traditional navigation systems (such as Google Maps) in its design to prevent people from misusing it.

The main drawback of Stupid AI, in my opinion, is that it may provide people with incorrect information. When people are not aware, their brains may default to trusting the AI and assume that the information is correct. Especially for issues related to knowledge, morality, and legality, it is not suitable to design Stupid AI to confuse people's judgments. However, since Stupid Guide only gives directions to people, it is less likely to involve these types of problems.
